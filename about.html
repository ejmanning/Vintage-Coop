        <p>A housing cooperative is joint ownership in a housing development in which members own a share. Members or share owners are a part of the cooperative, which owns the building, land and common areas. The value of the share is based on the size and type of home. Members pay a monthly fee, which is used to cover the cooperative’s monthly operating costs, including principle, interest, taxes, reserves, maintenance and utilities.</p><br>

        <p>Cooperatives are operated by their members, through a member elected Board of Directors. The Board of Directors governs policy, forms committees and is responsible for decision-making on behalf of the cooperative community. Professional management provides on-site staff, human resource management, accounting services and oversight of day-to-day Operations.</p><br>

        <p>Cooperatives bring back the spirit of community and sociability. The participatory nature of a cooperative enhances the lives of its members and contributes to healthier living. While members can enjoy the privacy of their individual home, there are many opportunities for social involvement with other members who have similar interests. This may take the form of running for the Board of Directors, participating on a committee, attending social programs or joining with friends in daily leisure activities, such as: playing cards, group exercise or golf.</p><br>
